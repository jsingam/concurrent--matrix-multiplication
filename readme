This codes are developed for the lab4 of Concurrent Programing module.
The codes can be compliled using this method.

for sequencial:
	to compile:
		g++ -o sequence sequentialMatrixMultiplication.cpp -fopenmp
	to run:
		./sequence <int dim> (eg: ./sequence 1000)


for parallel:
	to compile:
		g++ -o parallel parallelMatrixMultiplication.cpp -fopenmp
	to run:
		./parallel <int dim> (eq: ./parallel 1000)

for optimal:
	to compile:
		g++ -o optimal optimalMatrixMultiplication.cpp -fopenmp
	to run:
		./optimal <int dim> (eg: ./optimal 1000)
